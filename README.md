# Transport

⚠️ In development

## Overview

This library provides a robust solution for implementing a communication layer between clients and servers using RabbitMQ as the transport mechanism and GraphQL for query handling. It abstracts the complexity of direct RabbitMQ interactions and GraphQL query parsing, offering a straightforward interface for sending queries and mutations, and receiving responses asynchronously. Designed for high-performance, scalable applications, it ensures efficient message delivery and flexible query capabilities.

## Features

1. GraphQL Query and Mutation Support: Execute GraphQL queries and mutations seamlessly over RabbitMQ.
1. Asynchronous Communication: Utilize RabbitMQ's capabilities for asynchronous request-reply patterns.
1. Scalable and Robust: Designed for scalability and robustness with RabbitMQ as the underlying message broker.
1. Easy Integration: Simple API for quick integration into existing Node.js applications.
1. Customizable: Extensible to support custom query resolvers and mutation handlers.
